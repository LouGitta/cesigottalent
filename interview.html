                Since how many years do you are interested in football ?</strong><br><br>
                Abdellah’s Answer : It’s from my childhood, I started to see the older in my neighborhood play football. I see them and I just loved so I tried, first in the street, after in a club. So, I stared at 10 years old. <br><br>
                Ziyad’s Answer : For me it’s just like Abdellah, I’m stared to play in the street, so I was playing with my friend or my brothers when I was maybe 8 years old. I played in a football club when I was 11. <br><br>
                <strong>Ok so you are 25 & 20 years old ! This passion began early in your life !
                Did you have idols in this sport when you were little ?</strong><br><br>
                Abdellah’s Answer : When I was little, I loved you know the show in football, so I liked players like Ronaldinho & Christiano Ronaldo. It was just for the show, now I prefer middle fielder  who create the game.<br><br>
                Ziyad’s Answer : When I was young, I liked players like Ronaldo or Neymar for the content they proposed.<br><br>
                <strong>Nice, famous one ! Is it always the same idols or does it change for now ?</strong><br><br>
                Abdellah’s Answer : My idols changed because like I said first It was for the show, you know like Ronaldinho did a lot of strikes for It was for that. Now I prefer middle header because without them you can’t win, so for now I prefer players like Kroose or Inesta but yeah now I’m gonna to say players like Modric<br><br>
                Ziyad ’s Answer : I don’t watch anymore football like before, but my favorite player now it’s Lionel Messi. For me it’s the best player. <br><br>
                <strong>Perfect !<br><br>
                How did you become so good at this sport ? Were you coached by somebody ?</strong><br><br>

I’m remember that the first years in watched a lot of YouTube videos and try to do the same things that I saw all days I started to jungle and after to shoot you know when you play in the street you play a lot and after month you just be better. With time of training, you learned a lot. Also, I was coached by an older in my neighborhood, his name is Thomas. He trained me a lot and gave me advice.<br><br>
                Ziyad ’s Answer : For me I became better, because I’m not the best player but I think I became better with myself or with coach like Abdellah or friends. Also, a thing that help me a lot is to play hard but with no competition, with no pression, like practice with friends after school.<br><br>
